    What is the operating ratio?<br>
    the operating ratio is a measurement of how cost-efficient a company is by comparing it's oerating costs to it's sales.<br>
    How to calculate operating ratio?<br>
    To calculate operating ratio you should use the following formula:<br>
    operating ratio = (cost of goods sold (COGS) + operating expenses) / net sales<br>
    example: company x had reported a net sales of $5,230,000 in the previous year and the cost of goods sold was %3,100,000 and the total operating expenses were $890,000, calculate the operating ratio of the company.<br>
    using the operating ratio formula the answer will be:<br>
    operating ratio = (cost of goods sold + operating expenses) / net sales<br>
    operating ratio = ($3,100,000 + $890,000) / $5,230,000<br>
    operating ratio = 76%<br>
    Why use operating ratio?<br>
    the operating ratio is used to whow how efficient a company's management is at keeping the cost low while generating revenue or sales.<br>
